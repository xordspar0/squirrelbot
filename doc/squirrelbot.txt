NAME
----

squirrelbot - a Telegram bot that stashes links

SYNOPSIS
--------

*squirrelbot* --address=VALUE [--port=VALUE] --token=VALUE [--dir=VALUE]

*squirrelbot* --help | -h

DESCRIPTION
-----------

SquirrelBot is a Telegram bot that saves links that you send it for viewing
later. It saves Youtube videos and formats them for easy viewing in Kodi.

OPTIONS
-------

*--address*=<Web address> ::
	The domain name or IP address of the server where this bot can be
	reached.

*--token*=<telegram token> ::
	The authentication token for the Telegram API. You can find directions
	for obtaining your token at <https://core.telegram.org/bots>.

*--port*=<port number> ::
+
--
The port to run the server on. *Default*: 1327

I use a reverse proxy to forward traffic from port 443 to SquirrelBot's
default port. You can also set up SquirrelBot directly on port 80 or 443.
Just make sure to use the appropriate port for your url scheme:

*	Port 80 for http://
*	Port 443 for https://
--

*--dir, -d*=<path> ::
	The directory to store downloaded files.

*--version, -v* ::
	Show the version and exit.

*--help, -h* ::
	Show the help message and exit.

TRANSFERING VIDEO FILES
-----------------------

SquirrelBot downloads videos to a local directory that can be specified with the
`--dir` option. The videos are formatted to be easy to view in Kodi. If you run
this bot on a different server than your Kodi/media center, you will want to
transfer your video files to your Kodi or media center box. Here are a couple
ways to do that.

.Sync with rsync

*	On the receiving end, set up an rsync daemon that allows write-only access
	to the right directory.
*	On the sending end, write a simple script that uses `inotifywait` to copy
	files via rsync.
*	Optionally, after the file is successfully send, the script should delete
	the file from the server.

.Sync with Syncthing

You can use Syncthing to send video files to their final destination. See
https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html for instructions.
